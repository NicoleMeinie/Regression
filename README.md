# Zindi Regression Challenge

This challenge aims to predict the estimated time of delivery of orders, from the point of driver pickup to the point of arrival at final destination.

The dataset provided by Sendy includes order details and rider metrics based on orders made on the Sendy platform. The challenge is to predict the estimated time of arrival for orders- from pick-up to drop-off.

Sendy provides an API as well as a web and mobile application platform to link customers who have delivery needs with vetted transporters. The customers select their vehicle of choice, get their price quote upfront and pay using various payment options. The system optimises the route, looks for the closest available riders and dispatches the orders in the most efficient way.

## Motivation

The solution will help Sendy enhance customer communication and improve the reliability of its service; which will ultimately improve customer experience. In addition, the solution will enable Sendy to realise cost savings, and ultimately reduce the cost of doing business, through improved resource management and planning for order scheduling.
