# Zindi Regression Challenge

Sendy provides an API as well as a web and mobile application platform to link customers who have delivery needs with vetted transporters. The customers select their vehicle of choice, get their price quote upfront and pay using various payment options. The system optimises the route, looks for the closest available riders and dispatches the orders in the most efficient way.

This challenge aims to predict the estimated time of delivery of orders, from the point of driver pickup to the point of arrival at final destination.
